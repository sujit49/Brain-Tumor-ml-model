# Brain-Tumor-ml-model
This project implements a full deep-learning pipeline for automatic brain tumor segmentation from multi-modal MRI scans using a 3D UNet architecture. Built on the BraTS 2020 dataset, the system processes four complementary MRI sequences — FLAIR, T1, T1ce, and T2 — to accurately localize tumor regions in 3D brain volumes.
